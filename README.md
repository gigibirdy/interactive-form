# interactive-form

This project was developed to show/hide input fields of a form or implement error messages to interact with user. With jQuery,
the script.js file will run exactly the same in all major browsers. 

Notice that the email address input validation is based on regex pattern. To validate whether an email address is real, 
best pratice is to send a validation email to submitted address and request user to open up the email, click the url, and
confirm email address from there. Same thing with credit card number, card holder's name, zip code and CVV number, validation 
will need support of 3rd party resouces and additional code.
